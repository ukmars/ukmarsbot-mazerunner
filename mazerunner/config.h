// Battery resistor bridge //Derek Hall//
// The battery measurement is performed by first reducing the battery voltage
// with a potential divider formed by two resistors. Here they are named R1 and R2
// though that may not be their designation on the schematics.
//
// Resistor R1 is the high-side resistor and connects to the battery supply
// Resistor R2 is the low-side resistor and connects to ground
// Battery voltage is measured at the junction of these resistors
// The ADC port used for the conversion will have a full scale reading (FSR) that
// depends on the device being used. Typically that will be 1023 for a 10-bit ADC as
// found on an Arduino but it may be 4095 if you have a 12-bit ADC.
// Finally, the ADC converter on your processor will have a reference voltage. On
// the Arduinos for example, this is 5 Volts. Thus, a full scale reading of
// 1023 would represent 5 Volts, 511 would be 2.5Volts and so on.
//
// in this section you can enter the appropriate values for your ADC and potential
// divider setup to ensure that the battery voltage reading performed by the sensors
// is as accurate as possible.
//
// By calculating the battery multiplier here, you can be sure that the actual
// battery voltage calulation is done as efficiently as possible.

/***
 * Speed Feedforward is used to add a drive voltage proportional to the motor speed
 * The units are Volts per mm/s and the value will be different for each
 * robot where the motor + gearbox + wheel diamter + robot weight are different
 * You can experimentally determine a suitable value by turning off the controller
 * and then commanding a set voltage to the motors. The same voltage is applied to
 * each motor. Have the robot report its speed regularly or have it measure
 * its steady state speed after a period of acceleration.
 * Do this for several applied voltages from 0.5Volts to 3 Volts in steps of 0.5V
 * Plot a chart of steady state speed against voltage. The slope of that graph is
 * the speed feedforward, SPEED_FF.
 * Note that the line will not pass through the origin because there will be
 * some minimum voltage needed just to ovecome friction and get the wheels to turn at all.
 * That minimum voltage is the BIAS_FF. It is not dependent upon speed but is expressed
 * here as a fraction for comparison.
