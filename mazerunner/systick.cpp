/***
 * This is the SYSTICK ISR. It runs at 500Hz by default.
 *
 * All the time-critical control functions happen in here.
 *
 * interrupts are enabled at the start of the ISR so that encoder
 * counts are not lost.
 *
 * The last thing it does is to start the sensor reads so that they
 * will be ready to use next time around.
 *
 * Timing tests indicate that, with the robot at rest, the systick ISR
 * consumes about 10% of the available system bandwidth.
 *
 * With just a single profile active and moving, that increases to nearly 30%.
 * Two such active profiles increases it to about 35-40%.
 *
 * The reason that two profiles does not take up twice as much time is that
 * an active profile has a processing overhead even if there is no motion.
 *
 * Most of the load is due to that overhead. While the profile generates actual
 * motion, there is an additional load.
