/** TEST 5
 * Used to  calibrate the encoder counts per meter for each wheel.
 *
 * With the robot on the ground, start the test and push the robot in as
 * straight a line as possible over a known distance. 1000mm is best since
 * the encoder calibrations are expressed in counts per meter.
 *
 * Reports left count, right count, distance (mm) and angle (deg)
 *
 * At the end of the move, record the left and right encoder counts and
 * enter them into the configuration settings in config.h
 *
 * The values are likely to be different because the wheels will have
 * slightly different diameters. If you estimate the values in some other
 * way, and use the same value for both wheels, the robot is likely to
 * move in a slight curve instead of a straight line. A later test will let
 * you fine-tune these calibration value to get better straight line motion.
 *
 * Press the function button when done.

 * Test in both left and right directions and adjust the MOUSE_RADIUS to
 * get a reasonable average turn accuracy. The stock motors have a lot of
 * backash so this is never going to be high precision but you should be

 *
 * Maxumum angular velocity here should not exceed 1000 deg/s or the robot
 * is likely to begin to wander about because the centre of mass is not
 * over the centre of rotation.
 *
 * You can experiment by using the robot_angle instead of the
 * rotation.position() function to get the current angle. The robot_angle
 * is measured from the encoders while rotation.position() is the set
 * value from the profiler. There is no 'correct' way to do this but,
 * if you want repeatable results, always use the same technique.

/** TEST 13
 *
 * Once test 10 (sprint_and_return) are running successfully, it is time to get

 * that is used in test 10 but has the steering enabled.
 *
 * You will first need to set up the basic sensor reference values as described
 * in the README file.
 *
 * Once that is done, the robot is placed between parallel walls running for
 * as many cells as possible. When the test is started, the robot will run
 * forwards for the specified number of cells turn around and come back.
 *
 * While travelling (including the turn) the sensor values will be streamed
 * over the Serial device so that you can record values using BlueTooth for
 * later analysis.
 *
 * To tune the steering response, you can adjust the settings STEERING_KP
 * and STEERING_KD in config.h. Steering behaviour is achieved by using the
 * sensor cross-track-error to calculate an error angle. This error angle is
 * fed back into the controllers along with the angle obtained from the
 * encoders. The magnitude of the error is limited to the values given in
 * STEERING_ADJUST_LIMIT.
 *
 * It is possible that you will get adequate steering behaviour with only
 * proportional control (STEERING_KD = 0).
 *
 * You are looking for an smooth correction to initial errors in either
 * heading or offset. There should be no oscillation or weaving.
 *
 * Initial setup is done at a constant speed of 800mm/s.
