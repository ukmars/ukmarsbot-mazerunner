/**
 * Performs a turn. Regardless of whether the robot is moving or not
 *
 * The function is given three parameters
 *
 *  - angle  : positive is a left turn (deg)
 *  - omega  : angular velocity of middle phase (deg/s)
 *  - alpha  : angular acceleration of in/out phases (deg/s/s)
 *
 * If the robot is moving forward, it will execute a smooth, integrated
 * turn. The turn will only be repeatable if it is always performed at the
 * same forward speed.
 *
 * If the robot is stationary, it will execute an in-place spin turn.
 *
 * The parameter alpha will indirectly determine the turn radius. During
 * the accelerating phase, the angular velocity, will increase until it
 * reaches the value omega.
 * The minimum radius during the constant phase is
 *   radius = (speed/omega) * (180/PI)
 * The effective radius will be larger because it takes some time
 * for the rotation to accelerate and decelerate. The parameter alpha
 * controls that.
 *
 * Note that a real mouse may behave slightly different for left and
 * right turns and so the parameters for, say, a 90 degree left turn
 * may be slightly different to those for a 90 degree right turn.

/**
 * On entry, the robot is expected to be moving forwards at a suitable speed
 * for the turn. It is expected that this function is called at some fixed
 * predefined point before the turn. Since the turn is used during a maze
 * search, that point will be when the robot crosses the threshold between
 * cells. When the function exits, the robot should once more be on the
 * threshold between cells and still moving forwards.
 *
 * The radius if a turn is a function of the forward speed and the angular
 * velocity of the robot. radius = velocity/omega where omega is in rad/s.
 *
 * The turn can be tuned for a particular speed but will need to be retuned
 * for other speeds. There is a way to keep the turn shape invariant with
 * speed. See the Minos 2015 schedule:
 *
 * http://www.micromouseonline.com/2015/06/29/minos-2015-presentations/
 *
 *
 * You can normally expect the turn to be symmetrical.
 *
 * Five parameters affect the turn:
 *
 * run_in is the distance from the cell boundary to the beginning of the
 * actual turn.
 *
 * run_out is the distance from the end of the rotation to the threshold
 * with the next cell.
 *
 * @brief performs an integrated, smooth left turn at low speed.
